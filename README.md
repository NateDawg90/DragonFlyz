# Dragonflyz

This is a sidescrolling neverending flying game starring a dragon that shoots lasers. The objective is to fly for as long as possible without hitting a wall.

## Controls

Holding click or the spacebar will cause the dragon to rise into the air gradually, then more quickly.

## Rules

The dragon will constantly fly with the same horizontal velocity. If you collide with a wall, which will be going up and down the screen, you will have to start over. You also lose if you wall off the screen or fly too high and go off the screen. You can collect laser powerups which will allow you to shoot a laser that will destroy all obstacles in the laser's path. You can stockpile these laser shots for later use.

## Display

The game canvas will take up the entire browser. There will be a prompt screen where you press spacebar or click to begin, then the dragon will automatically fly forward.  The high score will be displayed in the upper right corner.
